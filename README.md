House Price Prediction Web App

A complete end-to-end Machine Learning + Flask project that predicts the price of a house based on multiple property features. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, model deployment, and a clean web interface for real-time predictions.

🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a regression model trained on housing data to estimate property prices.
It includes:

Full ML pipeline (preprocessing + model)

Flask-based web application

Real-time predictions from user input

Modular project structure with model/, app/, and data/

🛠️ Features

🔧 Preprocessing Pipeline

One-hot encoding for categorical features

Scaling numerical features

Automatic transformation using ColumnTransformer

🤖 Machine Learning Model

RandomForestRegressor (or your model)

Saved as pipeline.joblib

🌐 Web App

Built with Flask

Clean form-based UI

Instant price prediction
